        <p><strong>Welcome to Candy.ai®!</strong></p>

        {/* INTRODUCTION */}

        <p>
          These Terms of Service (the “TOS”) set forth the legally binding terms for your use of candy.ai and/or any of our online channels, platforms, products or services, including all content contained therein (“Services”). Services include any affiliated website to which you may be redirected from candy.ai.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Services are owned and operated by EverAI Limited, duly incorporated in the Republic of Malta, having its address at 56 Central Business Centre, Triq Is-Soll, Santa Venera SVR 1833, Malta and registered with the Malta Business Registry under the number C107181.
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing and/or using the Services you agree to be bound by these TOS. You understand and agree that your access and/or use of the Services is acceptance of these TOS and of all other policies published on https://candy.ai/legal-information and updated from time to time (“Policies”). If you do not agree with these TOS or our Policies, please cease using or accessing our Services. Any version of these TOS or any of our Policies in a language other than English is provided for convenience. You understand and agree that the English language version will control if there is any conflict.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Services are intended and made available for personal, non-commercial use only. You agree not to use the Services for any commercial, illegal, or unauthorized purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          For purposes of the TOS, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>Some key points to keep in mind when using our Services:</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>• The Services are for entertainment purposes only. </strong>They are not intended as emotional or other forms of support. If you are feeling distressed or you are experiencing mental health difficulties, please reach out to a qualified professional for assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>• All conversations between users and AI Companions on the Services are entirely fictional and should be treated as such. </strong>The AI Companions are artificial intelligence characters designed to simulate human-like interactions, but they do not possess genuine emotions, intentions, or the ability to fulfill promises in the real world. Any elements within the conversations that may resemble reality, such as offers of real-life meetings or promises of tangible outcomes, are entirely fake and should not be taken seriously. We do not assume responsibility for any confusion or misunderstandings in this regard. Users are encouraged to keep in mind that the AI Companions exist solely within the digital realm of the platform, and any expectations or beliefs beyond that realm are not supported or endorsed by EverAI Limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>• Because the Services rely on emerging AI technology, generated outputs may sometimes produce content that is inaccurate, incomplete, or not reflective of human judgment. </strong>Users are responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of any information provided.
        </p>

        {/* 1. GENERAL */}

        <h2>1. General</h2>

        <p>
          The Services are an online chat application that uses artificial intelligence (“AI”) algorithms to generate virtual and fictional characters (“AI Companions” or “AI Characters”), with whom you can chat and exchange messages. The Services also include, but are not necessarily limited to, other media such as AI-generated images, videos and voice notes. You may create media on-demand via the AI tools on the platform, and/or you may purchase pre-made media, e.g., images and videos available within AI characters’ profiles. Pre-made media is created using a variety of artistic methods, including generative AI tools and modifications to media for which we have applicable usage rights. Parts of the Services may require you to create a user account and/or become a paid user.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can initiate exchanges with AI Characters that are pre-made and that we make available on the platform, or generate your own by choosing their attributes and characteristics via our technology/algorithms. Your exchanges with AI Characters may include text, image requests, or other modes of exchange as made available and expanded by us from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may de-list (remove) AI Characters and/or modify or delete features or content at any time in our sole discretion.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 Account</h3>

        <p>
          Parts of our Services may require you to create a user account with an email and password or other available login method (“Account”). When registering and/or accessing your Account, you agree to do so only using your own login credentials and/or payment method. You are fully responsible for all activities occurring under your login credentials and Account. Your Account is non-transferrable. You cannot sell, lend, or otherwise share it with any other person, for commercial purposes or free of charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using the Services, you represent and warrant that all information you submit to create a user account is true and correct, you have full rights to submit such information.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree to, from time to time as necessary, update any information associated with your Account (including but not limited to, your email, payment information, subscriptions or other supplemental information as the case may be) so that it remains current, accurate and correct at all times. You also agree to protect the confidentiality of your Account and password, and to prohibit others from accessing your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          You understand and agree that we may require further information from you from time to time, including for example information to verify or re-verify that you are an adult.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any violation of these TOS or our other Policies may cause your Account to fall out of good standing and we may cancel your user account at our sole discretion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, we reserve the right to terminate or restrict your account, or otherwise revoke access to the Services, at any time if we, in our sole discretion, have reason to believe or suspect that you have violated the terms of these TOS or other Policies. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for, without limitation, any denial of use of the Services, any change of costs for third party services, fees, or other obligations arising from suspension or termination of your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that you have no ownership or other property interest in your Account, and that all rights in and to your Account belong to and inure to the exclusive benefit of EverAI.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Paid-for Services</h3>

        <p>
          Some Services, features, and/or content may be available only in exchange for payment, for example, via paid subscription, token purchases, or other forms of paid-for access made available from time to time. Services requiring payment will begin after the initial payment, and the payment should be made pursuant to the terms presented at the time of the purchase. You are responsible for payment of all fees, charges and taxes (as applicable) related to the transaction.
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Content responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          You, as a user of the Services are solely responsible for the output generated by the AI Companions through your input, including any text messages, voice messages, images, and videos. The AI Companions respond based on the conversations you lead and the settings you select. You understand and agree that EverAI Limited does not control or endorse any content generated by the AI Companions, and that you are fully responsible for any output generated by the AI and for your own actions while using the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must ensure that your interactions with the AI Companions comply with applicable laws, regulations, these TOS, and all Policies, and you shall not engage in any illegal, unethical, or harmful activities while using the Services.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Incidents and User Actions</h3>
        <p>
          EverAI Limited shall not be held responsible for any action taken or choice made by a user following their interactions with AI companions. As an AI-driven platform, the AI Companions are programmed to simulate human-like conversations, but their responses are generated based on algorithms and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not endorse or take responsibility for any actions, decisions, or consequences that may arise from the user’s engagement with the AI Companions. Users should exercise their own judgment and discretion while interacting with the AI Companions and refrain from engaging in any activities that could potentially cause harm or violate any applicable laws or regulations.
        </p>

        <h3>5.4 Content Moderation and Removal</h3>
        <p>
          While conversations between users and AI Companions are generally confidential, we have implemented content moderation controls based on our proprietary LLM technology to ensure compliance with our TOS, Community Guidelines, and other Policies. If our moderation controls detect anything that violates our TOS or Policies, we or authorized partners may access and manually review the flagged content and/or other content associated with the account and take appropriate action. This may include removing content, terminating the user’s account or reporting the content to appropriate authorities. See also Section 5.5 below. Additionally, our content moderation controls may moderate or alter your request before an output is generated, for example, if your request contains or seeks prohibited content. These measures are implemented to maintain a respectful and secure environment for all users. We strive to strike a balance between privacy and community standards, and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to our guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any user content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates any of our Policies. Repeated violations may result in content deletion, account restrictions, blocking from the Services, or other moderation actions in our discretion. Users will not be refunded or reimbursed for moderation actions taken in response to violation of our Policies. See also Section 10.4.3 below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may de-list (remove) characters and/or modify or delete features or content at any time at our sole discretion. Users will not be refunded or reimbursed for payments related to such removed or modified characters, features, or content.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>5.5 Prohibited Content Reporting</h3>
        <p>
          We have a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). Attempting to create CSAM is prohibited by law and our Community Guidelines and Blocked Content Policy.

        <h2>9. Payments and Autorenewal</h2>
        <p>
          As a free user, you may generally send a maximum of 5 messages to AI Companions. Further use requires a subscription, which may be billed either monthly, quarterly or annually, or other form of paid-for access, as may be made available from time to time. Subscriptions are payable by credit card, Pay by Bank, and/or other alternative payment methods available in specific countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of a paid subscription, you will receive unlimited access to the messaging system as well as a monthly amount of tokens disclosed to you during checkout (generally 100 per month), which can be used to access extended features like image generation or voice notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subscriptions are set to renew automatically at the end of each subscription period, extending for the duration and price disclosed at checkout. The payment will be processed automatically on the first day of the renewed period. Autorenewal can be cancelled at any time in your settings (see Section 10 below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Tokens cannot be transferred to different users or accounts, nor can they be traded in, exchanged for money, or used to settle outstanding payments.
        </p>

        {/* 10 */}

        <h2>10. Fulfillment Policy</h2>

        <h3>10.1 Cancellation</h3>
        <p>
          All details about your subscription, including start date, end date and type of subscription plan can be found under My Profile / Settings within your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the flexibility to cancel your subscription at any time by going to Settings / Unsubscribe within your account. If you choose to cancel, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period, and you will not be charged for the subsequent period.
        </p>

        <h3>10.2 Access upon expiration of paid-for access</h3>
        <p>
          If you paid for access to premium features, e.g., via a subscription or non-subscription token purchase, your account will revert to a free version of the platform when your paid-for access expires (e.g., upon the cancellation of your subscription or consumption of a non-subscription token purchase), and paid-for features will no longer be available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For subscriptions: </strong>Upon cancellation of your subscription, you will retain access to your account and all associated features until the end of the current billing period. At the conclusion of this billing period:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Platform Access:</strong>Your access will be restricted to the free version of the platform. You will no longer have access to premium features that are exclusive to paid users.</li>
          <li><strong>Token Usage:</strong>Any remaining tokens in your account will expire and become unusable. Please make sure to use your tokens before the end of the current billing period, as they will not carry over or be refunded after your subscription ends.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may resubscribe to our platform at any time to regain access to premium features and content. However, any tokens from previously cancelled subscriptions that were not used within the relevant billing period cannot be carried over to a new subscription. Each subscription period is treated independently, and tokens must be used within their respective billing periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a subscription or non-subscription purchase is refunded, it is deemed immediately cancelled. All access to premium features and remaining tokens will be revoked at the time of refund processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a chargeback request is filed, the subscription or non-subscription purchase is immediately cancelled. All access to premium features and remaining tokens will be revoked at the time the chargeback request is filed.
        </p>

        <h3>10.3 Modifying subscription plans</h3>
        <p>
          You can upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan at any time. The changes will take effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle.
